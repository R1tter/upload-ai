# ðŸŽ¥ Upload AI

Upload AI is an application that allows users to upload a video, transcribe it to audio, and then transcribe that audio to text. The magic begins when we use the powerful OpenAI API to interpret this text. Based on a prompt generated by the application, we provide suggestions for titles, descriptions, and hashtags, all adjusted according to the "creativity temperature" defined for the AI model.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Frontend

Here are the available scripts for working on the frontend:

#### `npm run dev`
Starts the development server using Vite.

#### `npm run build`
First, it compiles the project with TypeScript (`tsc`), then builds the project for production using Vite.

#### `npm run lint`
Lints the code, focusing on `.ts` and `.tsx` files, reporting unused directives, and failing on any warnings.

#### `npm run preview`
Offers a built project preview using Vite.

### Backend

Here are the available scripts for working on the backend:

#### `npm run dev`
Runs the server in development mode, monitoring changes with `tsx`.

#### `npm run prisma:seed`
Runs the database seed using Prisma.

To execute any of the above scripts, you can use:
```sh
npm run [script-name]
```

For example, to start the frontend development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```

And to start the backend development server:
